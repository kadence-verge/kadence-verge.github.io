			<p> Alternative music, also known as alternative rock is a subform of punk rock music that came about in 
					1980s, but became more popular in the 1990s. Alternative music is different from normal rock
					because it veers away from mainstream rock music. It is defined by its distorted guitar sound, 
					transgressive lyrics, and defiant attitude.  
				</p>
				<p>Alternative rock is a genre of music that consists of a lot of differing sounds. It has many subgenres
					such as: britpop, indie rock, grunge, post-rock, and math rock. The typical instruments for
					alternative music are vocals, electric guitar, bass, drums, and the keyboard. In the beginning 
					alternative was not mainstream until the 1990s when the band Nirvana and subgenres such as grunge and 
					britpop became popular. 
				</p>
				<p>Again, alternative rock died down but was revived in the early 21st century. Some new popular bands
					you may know are The Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The White Stripes, U2, The Killers, 
					Foo Fighters, Coldplay, and Thirty Seconds to Mars.
				</p>
				<p>The song, "The Pretender" by the Foo Fighters is a good example of alternative music today. The song 
					"Smells Like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana was and still is a very popular alternative song.
