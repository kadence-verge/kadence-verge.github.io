			<p> Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" 
					in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles 
					in the 1960s and later, particularly in the US and UK. It was heavily influenced by 
					country and blues.  Musically, rock has centered on the electric guitar, usually as 
					part of a rock group with electric bass guitar and drums. 
				</p>
				<p>In the late 1960s, referred to as the "golden age" or "classic rock" period, a number
					of distinct rock music sub-genres had emerged, psychedelic rock and heavy metal.  In the
					second half of the 1970s, punk rock emerged to produce a raw, energetic form of music
					characterized by overt social and political critiques. Punk was an influence into the
					1980s on the subsequent development of other sub-genres, including new wave, post-punk
					and eventually the alternative rock movement. From the 1990s alternative rock began to
					dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop,
					and indie rock. 
				</p>
				<p>Rock music has been associated with political activism as well as changes in social
					attitudes to race, sex and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth
					revolt against adult consumerism and conformity.
				</p>
				<p>"All Along The Watchtower," a Bob Dylan song performed by Jimi Hendrix, is a classic
					example of a well known rock song.
